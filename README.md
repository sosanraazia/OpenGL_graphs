# OpenGL_graphs
<p>
This repository consist of VS solution (2015). The solution consist of three .cpp files, which are used to plot different graphs in OpenGL. freeglut is required to compile and execute the code.</p>
<ol><li>
y=xsq.cpp will plot the graph of function y=x^2
</li><li>
sinx.cpp will plot the graph of function y=sin(x)
</li><li>
cosx.cpp will plot the graph of function y=cos(x)
</li></ol>
